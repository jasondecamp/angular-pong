## Pong in AngularJS

Needed some AngularJS practice and thought it would be fun to implement Pong. So far it's messy but it kind of works. Just jotting notes in the README for now.

Usage:

- put all files in one directory
- load pong.html in a browser
- serve using the Enter key, up/down arrow and w/s control paddles, ESC stops the game

Still needs:

- expose settings
- key capture module?
- one player mode
  * unused paddle follows ball
  * handicap computer - max paddle speed?
- add multiplayer with web sockets?
- make it work on phones
