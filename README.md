## Pong in AngularJS

I wanted to play with AngularJS without having a "useyness" agenda (i.e. doing something that I might regret not finishing) and thought it might be fun to implement Pong.\*

The computer player in one-player mode is still jittery. It should be beatable but that may vary depending on the host computer's performance. I put off working on the computer player algorithm because it was eating time and my goal is to learn to do things "the angular way". I have some ideas but none of them are really AngularJS specific. I'll get to it when I get to it. Feel free to contribute one. :)

The next major goal is to work more on modularity to get used to fitting re-usable pieces together. 

\* If anybody has copyright issues with this let me know and I will cease and desist immediately.

NOTES:

- still considering going back to a flat file structure (all files in one directory)

TODO:

- download angular and bootstrap files and get off CDNs
- key capture module?
- one player mode: work on better algorithm
- add multiplayer with web sockets?
- make it work on phones
