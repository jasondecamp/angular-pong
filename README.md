## Pong in AngularJS

I wanted to play with AngularJS without having a "useyness" agenda (i.e. doing something that I might regret not finishing) and thought it might be fun to implement Pong.\*

So far this works okay. The computer player in one-player mode is still jittery. It should be beatable but that may vary depending on the host computer's performance. I put off working on this algorithm since I'm trying to practice doing things the "angular way" and the algorithm doesn't appear to have a lot to do with AngularJS specifically. Feel free to contribute one.

\* If anybody has copyright issues with this let me know and I will cease and desist immediately.

NOTES:

- still considering going back to a flat file structure (all files in one directory)

TODO:

- key capture module?
- one player mode: work on better algorithm
- add multiplayer with web sockets?
- make it work on phones
